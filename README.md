# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Commercial Open Source License

A published commerical friendly open-source license for
[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) product licensing
purposes. This version adopted the
[Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0)
as its baseline and applied the following changes:

1. Changed `Software` to `Product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
   design, etc) without needing to spin multiple licenses; AND
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied; AND
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default.




## Version Controlled

This repository is version controlled using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) definitions where:

1. the `MAJOR` version denotes major legal changes; AND
2. the `MINOR` version denotes minor changes without altering the legal
   implication side of things such as but not limited to grammar correction,
   fonts, typo, and etc; AND
3. the `PATCH` version denotes the repository management changes such as but
   not limited to new language addition, updating `README.md`, and etc.
