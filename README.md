# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Commercial Open Source License

A published commerical friendly open-source license for
[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) product licensing
purposes. This version adopted the
[Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0)
as its baseline and applied the following changes:

1. Changed `Software` to `Product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
   design, etc) without needing to spin multiple licenses.
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied.
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default.
