  A published commerical friendly open-source license for
  "(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho" (https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) product licensing
  purposes. This version adopted the Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0
  License (https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0) as its baseline and
  applied the following changes:

  (1) Changed "Software" to "Product" so that the license can be expanded to
      non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
      design, etc) without needing to spin multiple licenses; AND
  (2) Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify
      when and how is the license applied; AND
  (3) Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
      default.

  This repository is version controlled using
  semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) definitions where:

  (1) the "MAJOR" version denotes major legal changes; AND
  (2) the "MINOR" version denotes minor changes without altering the legal
      implication side of things such as but not limited to grammar correction,
      fonts, typo, and etc; AND
  (3) the "PATCH" version denotes the repository management changes such as but
      not limited to new language addition, updating "README.md", and etc.
